# GoreeCloud App Store Features

## Implemented in the native bootstrap

- Native Android application shell using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
- Glaze-oriented tangible cards/surfaces, capsule-shaped search/account controls, adaptive Compose layout, and accessible 48dp-class controls.
- Discover, Apps, Services, Updates, and Library navigation.
- Search constrained to the already-entitled client catalog.
- Application and service item models.
- Development JSON catalog loader.
- Multi-user development session switcher.
- Explicit entitlement filtering with no implicit administrator bypass.
- Product-detail dialog with deliberately unavailable install/open action until delivery is trusted.
- Platform-integration checkpoint for Glaze UI, Identity, Wardveil, Privacy Shield, Everkeep, and Mesh.
- Unit tests and Android CI.
